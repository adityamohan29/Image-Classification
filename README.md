# Image-Classification
 Here, I present my code which was used to classify Leather Image samples into defective and non-defective ones. For this purpose, a simple random forest classifier was used.
 This was part of my Internship at Central Leather Research Institute in the summer of 2019. For confidentiality reasons, the images could not be put of for public use.
